### Awesome Whisper

#### 1. Official Whisper

- Introduction: [Whisper on OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/whisper)
- GitHub: [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
- Paper: [Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf)

#### 2. Whisper Model variants

Whisper-based implementations that improve speed, compatibility, or functionality.

- [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper): High-performance Whisper inference using CTranslate2 (CPU/GPU optimized)
- [mlx-whisper](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/tree/main/whisper): Whisper ported to Apple's MLX framework (runs on Apple Silicon)
- [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX): Word-level timestamps and speaker diarization built on Whisper

#### 3. Whisper Streaming Implementations

Experimental or community-based projects that adapt Whisper for real-time/streaming ASR.

- [ufal/whisper_streaming](https://github.com/ufal/whisper_streaming): Real-time Whisper with buffering and chunked inference
- [WhisperLiveKit](https://github.com/QuentinFuxa/WhisperLiveKit): Local real-time STT with speaker diarization, FastAPI server & web UI
